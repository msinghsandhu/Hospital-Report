# Hospital Report Using Power BI

## Problem Statement:
The hospital report dataset presents a valuable resource for understanding various aspects of healthcare delivery, patient outcomes, and operational performance within hospital settings. However, several challenges exist in effectively leveraging this dataset to address critical issues and improve overall healthcare quality. One significant problem to address is the identification of key factors influencing patient outcomes, such as mortality rates, readmission rates, and patient satisfaction scores. This requires comprehensive analysis of various data points including demographic information, medical history, treatment procedures, and hospital characteristics. Additionally, there is a need to develop predictive models to anticipate adverse events such as hospital-acquired infections or complications, enabling proactive interventions to mitigate risks and improve patient safety. Furthermore, improving data quality and interoperability across different healthcare systems is essential to ensure the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the dataset, facilitating more robust analysis and actionable insights. By addressing these challenges, stakeholders can enhance healthcare delivery, optimize resource allocation, and ultimately improve patient outcomes and satisfaction within hospital settings.

## Solution Approach:

To address the problem statement, the following approach was used:

### * Data Import and Initial Analysis: 
  The sales data was provided in a SQL dump file, which was imported into a SQL database. Initial insights were drawn from the data using SQL queries and analysis techniques to gain a preliminary understanding of the sales trend.

### *  Connecting SQL Database to Power BI: 
  The SQL database was connected to Power BI, establishing a live connection or importing the necessary data tables into Power BI.

### * Data Modeling and Relationship Creation: 
   Data modeling was performed within Power BI to create relationships between the relevant tables in the SQL database. This step ensured that the data could be properly analyzed and visualized.

### * Data Cleaning and Transformation: 
Power BI's data transformation features, such as Power Query, were utilized to clean and transform the data. Irrelevant entries, duplicates, and inconsistencies were removed or resolved, ensuring the data was accurate and reliable.

### * Dashboard Creation - Key Insights: 
This dashboard helps us to know the number of available beds in hospitals and the types of hospitals available in a state of USA.

Each dashboard was designed to be interactive, allowing users to filter and drill down into specific dimensions or time periods of interest.

## Expected Outcome:


   * Enhanced Data Analysis: The connection between the SQL database and Power BI enables real-time or near-real-time analysis of the Hospital infrastructure trends. The solution provides users with the ability to explore and analyze data more efficiently, leading to better insights and understanding.

   * Improved Decision Making: Using this we can improvise the infrastructure of hospitals in the cities where number of beds are less.

   * Increased Efficiency: By utilizing Power BI's data transformation features, data cleaning and transformation tasks are streamlined. This saves time and effort, allowing users to focus more on analyzing the data and extracting valuable insights.
